//Description

I first defined a VLANHost function,
remove IP from default, "physical" interface then  create its VLAN Interface so that hosts' IPs can be assigned to the VLAN's interface

Then I created another function MyTopology, where in I defined all the connections, that is which host is connected physically to which particular VLAN they belong. 

We test this by pingall in Mininet
