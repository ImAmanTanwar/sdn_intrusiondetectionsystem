//Description

I first defined a VLANHost function,
remove IP from default, "physical" interface then  create its VLAN Interface so that hosts' IPs can be assigned to the VLAN's interface

Then I created another function MyTopology, where in I defined all the connections, that is which host is connected physically to which particular VLAN they belong. 

We test this by pingall in Mininet


Problem given : 
Set bandwidth between host1 of vlan1 and host1 of vlan2. 

Solution :
We can define the policy with host1(v1) and host1(v2) by doing setting their bandwidth by : self.addLink(bw= 10)

I was not able to be solve the additional problem given though
